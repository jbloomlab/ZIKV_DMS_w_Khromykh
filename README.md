# Deep mutational scanning of ZIKV Natal strain in Vero and C6/36 cells

## Authors
[Yin Xiang Setoh](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1944), [Jesse Bloom](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html), [Alexander Khromykh](https://staff.scmb.uq.edu.au/staff/alexander-khromykh) 

## Goal
Setoh and Alex performed deep mutational scanning of the Natal strain of Zika virus. 
They are examining domain III of the E protein.

## Organization

The analysis is performed by the Jupyter notebook [analysis_notebook.ipynb](analysis_notebook.ipynb), which contains all the code and results.

The input files used in the analysis are all found in the `./data/` subdirectory.
Specifically:

  * `./data/NatalEDIII.fa` contains the sequence of the Natal ZIKV E domain III obtained from Setoh. This actually has DIII plus some regions upstream.

  * `./data/NatalEDIIIonly.fa` contains the sequence of only Natal ZIKV E domain III obtained from Setoh.
